Situated along the fringes of the Sholayar forest ranges, the Athirapally waterfalls plunge down from a staggering height of over 80 ft to join the Chalakudy River.
                The largest waterfall in Kerala, the Athirapally waterfall is an important tourist destination in Kerala. Originating as a sliver streak from the high ranges, and crashing through gorges lined with wild bushes and trees the waterfall gains strength and size as it thunders down at its final sojourn before it joins the rivers downstream. It is one of the best places in India to enjoy the serene charm of nature at its best.

An ideal spot to beat a retreat and to be in the lap of nature, Athirappally is easily accessible. Athirappally is bestowed with the best spectacles that you could ask for. The huge shady trees and the water spray from the falls make the whole area cool and refreshing even on a hot sunny day. Close to the dense green tropical forests, the waterfalls offer ample opportunities to explore the diverse flora and fauna. It is home to many important species including the rare Forest Cane Turtle, the endangered Great Indian Hornbill, the Lion-Tailed Macaque and the Nilgiri Langur. You can spot large families of monkeys and giant squirrels jumping across the trees that attract the attention of visitors and shutterbugs alike.
