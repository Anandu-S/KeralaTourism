The Parassinikadavu Snake Park is home to over 150 different species of reptiles like crocodiles, monitor lizards and snakes- both venomous and non-venomous. Not only reptiles and amphibians, but this snake park also goes a long way to preserve and protect many wild mammals, marine creatures as well as rare avifauna- both endemic and migratory.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The establishment of Parassinikadavu Snake Park was an initiative of the Visha Chikista Kendra, a medical institution that offers diagnosis and treatment of snakebites. The main motto behind establishing this park was to clarify undue superstitions about snakes, educate the common man about these species and create the right awareness among them. Each enclosure of the different species of animals has a brief description of their habitat, moods, peculiarities and interesting titbits that educate the visitors about these exotic and truly extraordinary species. Visiting this park is an absolute treat for the wildlife enthusiasts and animal lovers. You will be stunned by the unique and admirable traits of many of the park's inhabitants and will undoubtedly be left in awe of nature's wondrous creations.
